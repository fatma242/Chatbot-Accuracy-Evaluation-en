"Seroquel makes depressed I have major depressive disorder and social anxiety  I take  400mg seroquel for sleep and have a weird side effect , when I take it makes me have those sudden life realisations about my self *really bad thoughts” 

Exactly like a bad weed trip and that’s why I stopped smoking weed .

It’s weird since I’ve tried all drugs from benzos and opium to ssris and snri and it’s the only drug that makes me feel this way 

Why I am feeling this way? I searched a lot and couldn’t find people with the same problem",Anxiety
"Frequent cold sores (ulcers) on lips and intense fear of Bell’s Palsy returning Hi all, frequently ill and frequently anxious person here. I’m going to be seeing my doctor (again) to ask about this issue but lately (past few months) after a really bad flu that resulted in a mouth full of ulcers and palsy afterward (which I luckily recovered from), I’ve been terrified of this happening again. I feel I have been getting more frequent tiny ulcers on my mouth almost every month or so. It scares me every time I feel a warm bump. I have no idea why they are so much more common now and it’s disheartening (and discouraging - they’re ugly!). And, it scares me that the palsy could return or flare up again as I’ve read that it’s very possible :( 

All of this stresses me out so much and I know that can’t be doing my body any favors. Just wanted some comfort as I try and deal with the fear and the actual physical symptoms.",Anxiety

"Health anxiety taking over my life Since I got the flu this year, I’ve been constantly worrying about my health. I wake up in a panic every day. I am constantly worrying that I’m losing my vision or that I have MS, brain tumor, etc. I’ve gotten blood work that all came back perfect. I’m only a teenager but these worries are controlling me all the time. I’ve been on medication for a month and a half and started seeing a therapist a couple of weeks ago but it still isn’t doing the trick. Are there any tips that you guys can give? I’m beginning to feel hopeless. ",Anxiety
"worried i have something seriously wrong to start off i’m pretty sure i’m suffering from depersonalization/derealization. after i smoked weed (even though i had smoked many times before) about a month ago i just had that unreal feeling. apparently this is very common. smoking weed, having a panic attack, and then BAM depersonalized. 
i have anxiety and depression, so even though what this is is most likely just depersonalization i cant help but think it’s something worse. like a brain tumor or something.
i am nearsighted so i do have blurred vision (bit with things close up like looking at my hands or something close to me) but recently i’ve noticed sort of vertical doubled vision? if i look at something i can see a little bit of a ghost image above it it’s sort of hard to explain. it’s only for far away objects and it’s worse when looking at letters like on a tv or poster. i read somewhere that this could be just from being nearsighted and it isn’t double vision. i also read on a forum where somebody thought they had a brain tumor to do the “pinhole test” where you make a small circle with your fingers and put it close to your eye and if the double vision goes away it’s an ocular problem and not neurological, which made me feel better.
i’ve had no headaches but bad memory and trouble focusing as well as the not feeling real feeling.
i kinda just need reassurance because health anxiety is a hard ass thing to deal with i’ve been terrified for a month of a serious medical issue!",Anxiety
"Possibly letting anxiety get to me? I am the type of poster that you will hate. I'm fully aware that I am 90% of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety, it's been my MO for awhile.

I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments. When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that. The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat.

Woke up at the lady's house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car. I've talked to her since and she's the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off. She said “you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out. Don't know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didn't say anything when you got back in”.

That was last Friday night/Saturday morning. It's not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck. Sore throat, head stuffed up, probably one of the worst coughs I've ever had. Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV. As far as I've been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part. I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand. I may have just forgotten to replace it. I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day. I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me.

I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious. But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested. Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days? The only thing I can find about those is through this site: https://www.stdcheck.com/hiv-rna-test.php

And I'm not sure how trustworthy that is. Thanks in advance!",Anxiety
I'm afraid the anxiety is too much because I'm already in the phase of being really scared,Anxiety
"I have an appointment with yet another specialist next week, and I feel like it's not even worth it because my symptoms are probably all in my head. I have had so many little health issues over the years that I worked up with my anxiety. Googling things constantly, always asking the doctor about every little thing. Every single damn time, I end up at a specialist and get a bunch of expensive tests just to find out nothing's wrong. It's all in my head. 

I have an appointment with an allergist next week to find out what caused a bad reaction... But now, all I can think is that the reaction was not real. It was probably just a panic attack. I'm sure all the tests will come back normal again, and I'll be left with regret and a big bill as I'm reminded that I'm still just a hypochondriac.",Anxiety

I just wanted express my feelings to someone because in my life I do not have anyone who could really understand, a lot of empathetic faces with a smile, but no one that really knows how it feels. I feel the tears on my eyes, my breath is caught in my throat. The thought of ending it is non stop in my mind but I know that I will not ever do it, I do not want to hurt anybody and making others happy I will continue to suffer inside.

It sucks, being diagnosed for major depressive disorder and being bi polar. I have been on medication for about 2 years now and nothing has change, you get episodes that lasts for weeks. Almost died for about 5 times already and still i am here. Still suffering. I starter going back to church re establishing my faith, opening my heart out go god, but its still nothing.

I do not amount to anything. I struggle to find meaning for my existence. I want to do something but i am to weak. I feel hopeless. I am just leeching off life and not doing anything.

I feel like everyone is better than me and i hate it. I also hate that i might deserve this suffering.

I am an alcoholic and have been trying on and off for a year to stop drinking. I have gone 4 days now sober after drinking a half bottle of tequila every day for over a month straight. The last week that I had been drinking I came pretty close to commiting suicide. Scared myself and decided I needed to be serious about being sober. Now that I am on a sober streak its even worse. My minds more clear so the pain and loneliness feels worse. My minds more clear so making and following through with a plan seems easier I thought being sober would stop these feelings,Suicidal
"I do not know who I am talking to, but sorry for so many posts lately. I have been more active on this sub in the last month than I have been on all of Reddit in years.I think I just need someone to say this to while I figure things out.I have been dealing with suicidal ideation for almost 15 years. I can tell anyone the story of how when I was 12 years old I realized that dying would not bother me, but that is not what this is about. My life since then has always gone impulses, brief periods where I will be okay and productive, followed by increasingly longer and darker cycles where I am down, sad, depressed, unreachable, easily offended, and just generally not the kind of person I ever pictured I would be. And, because I have been dealing with this for so long, I know how to handle these periods, and I have always managed to cling through. I went through a really bad one a couple of years ago, which actually led to my first-ever post on this site, but I made it.But this time feels different. It started a little over two months ago, and drastically got worst a couple weeks back. Something about this does not feel like the norm, where I will think about ending it, imagine what life would be without me, and eventually snap out of it. Something about this feels more serious, more accepting. None of my old methods are working. When I try to make lists of people who will miss me, I said come up with list about how they would react to hearing killed myself, and cannot find anything that is motivating me to stay. When I try to think about everything that I be giving up if I were to end my life, like the show arcs that I will never get to finish, or the paintings I will never get to lay to canvas, none of it is enough to make me want to stay.Nothing is working. It scares me that I have reached this point of acceptance, because this does not feel like a hypothetical wondering of what life would be like if I were not part of it. I am starting to feel an acceptance seep into my bones, and I worry that I am not going to make it to my 28th birthday next year . . . Which has been my goal since I was 18.I do not know what I hope to come out of posting on here, but I guess I just wanted to be able to say to someone. I do not have any friends or family I can talk to you. do not get me wrong, I do have them, but none of them want to hear my problems, and those who do one understand it. I am not saying it is definitely going to happen, but I am saying that I am getting really scared, and to feel alone, and I think I know what is coming, and I am not sure what to do.Does anyone else know this? Have any of you managed to find your way back? Because I am at the point where I am deliberately taking long lunches on the roof so that here soon I can 'slip' and leave this place without anyone having to know that I chose to go.I am so lost.

I am 30 thousand dollars in debt in student loans, the schooling for which has never helped me get a single job. I have never made much more than minimum wage and I have never even put a dent in paying off the loans. What a waste of time and money school was.I have violent thoughts towards myself all the time and often I find myself thinking about violence against faceless entities like ""the government"" or ""the rich"". I have sought mental health help for many, many years in many, many forms and there is nothing that seems to help me cope with my lack of success. I am on pills now and they make me feel less angry but not less sad. I am really thinking that I may not be able to hold my resolve against my growing instinct that I would be better off just ending things.What should I do? (Going to the hospital never yields results, I have done that a number of times and quite frankly I do not need to be put on a 48 hour watch, I am not crazy, I am at the end of my rope -- I have no more fucks to give). I was going to tell my parents or my ex how I was feeling but I just keep stopping myself because I do not feel like putting the burden on them. So I searched 'suicide' on reddit and here I am.
